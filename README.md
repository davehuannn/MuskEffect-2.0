MuskEffect 2.0 is an updated Python script that monitors Elon Musk's tweets and analyzes their impact on cryptocurrency prices. The application fetches Elon Musk's recent tweets from the Twitter API, extracts relevant words, and correlates them with cryptocurrency names. Additionally, it utilizes the CoinMarketCap API to retrieve real-time information about the mentioned cryptocurrencies.

We have improve this script with additional information pulled from CoinMarketCap APIs and a newly generated text file together with a log file to a proposed email account.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed (version 3.x)
- Required Python packages: requests, requests_oauthlib
- Twitter Developer account with API keys and access tokens
- CoinMarketCap API key
- Gmail account for sending email notifications

## File Structure
logs/: Directory to store log files.
textfile/: Directory to store text files with Musk Effect details.
musk_effect_app.py: Main Python script for analyzing Elon Musk's tweets and correlating with cryptocurrency prices.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

## Output
The script generates log files in the logs/ directory and text files in the textfile/ directory. The log file provides detailed information about the Musk Effect, including correlated tweets and cryptocurrency details. The text file summarizes the Musk Effect details for easy reference.

## Email Notifications
The script sends an email with the log file and text file attached to the specified email address. Ensure that your Gmail account allows less secure apps or generate an app password for authentication.

Feel free to customize the script according to your needs. Happy monitoring
